            <p class="style13">Like most children of his time, Tim Wolcott’s&nbsp;&nbsp;life revolved around two eternal loves-&nbsp;&nbsp;delicious ice crean and adventuring in&nbsp;&nbsp;the great outdoors. </p>
            <p class="style14">And there was nothing quite like spending the day hiking through the local national parks with friends and family and then cooling down with a good scoop. </p>
            <div class="image0row3">
                <p class="style15">That’s why when the opportunity came to bring the best ice cream in the world to Big Bear Lake, it was only natural that he would partner with his daughter Carissa to open the fun, tasty, and ecofriendly Big Bear Ben & Jerry’s&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice
                    Cream Shoppe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Located in a beautifully-restored historic building and featuring hand-cut beams saved from the local forest mill, Big Bear Ben & Jerry’s combines scenic Southern Californian views with classic American charm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasting
                    a truly family-friendly atmosphere, they aim to provide the most delicious, freshly-made, non-GMO ice cream, cakes, and sundaes available anywhere!&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Tim and Carissa are excited to support both the local
                    community and national park services here in Big Bear by donating 5% of all sales from the iluvbigbear.com site to the National Park Foundation. As world renown landscape photographer, Tim doesn’t like the idea of losing any part of
                    a trail or a park due to budgetary cuts; especially when they allow people of all ages to enjoy and explore the natural beauty of our country while finding deeper meaning in their own lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;This donation will also go to
                    support The Bear Backers of Big Bear Valley, which allows kids to enjoy sports that will help give them balance and leadership skills throughout their life.</p>
